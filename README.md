## Description
The geoip-update script provides a simple and efficient way to update and download the latest geoip datatabases

## FYI
Unlike other maxmind database update scripts, this will only download the databases when they have been updated. The databases are extracted directly to the geoip dir and as such this script does not use a temp dir and a copy. The script will also create symbolic links to alias the various database names to legacy database names
